# Node Modules

## Review
Node REPL - can run javascript files interactively
Globals - like the Windows scope on the client,
 we have the global object that stores variables, etc. on the server side
Command line arguments - process.argv is an array of arguments
Arrays, Strings, etc - built in object types for javascript that have lots of methods and properties associated with them
