basic responsive bootstrap website
CSS display properties
    display:block for things that should be the full width of their container
    display:inline for things that do not have height and width (a, b, strong, i, em)
    display:inline-block for everything else.

practical loops (stop swearing!)
DOM events

built-in methods
    arrays: push, pop, join, indexOf, forEach, map, filter, sort
    strings: split, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, subString
    numbers: ???
    objects: ???
callbacks

//map example
var words = ['hi', 'bye', 'whatever']
var capitalWords = words.map(function(element){
    return element.toUpperCase()
})

// how much do we care about the thing we just popped off?
var myStuff = [1,2,3]
myStuff.pop()
var lastItem = myStuff.pop()

shift/unshift does the same thing as push/pop, except at the start of the array.

object oriented programming
    prototypal inheritance
