# Mongoose

To access Mongo we use the `mongoose` package for node.  First we install `mongoose`.

```sh
$ npm init  # creates package.json
$ npm install mongoose --save  # creates node_modules and installs mongoose and all of its dependencies there
```

From there, we can `require` mongoose in our javascript and access the mongo database programmatically.
