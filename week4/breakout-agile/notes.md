# Agile

Agile is a methodology used in business, software development in particular, which strives to be more responsive to customer requirements.

Stories are developed and assigned points.
Process is continuous or done in short intervals (sprints)
Historical velocity gives guidance to sprint capacity.
Individual stories (features, bugs, use-cases) are ranked against each other, but not individually estimated in terms of time.

## Waterfall
Old-school, long cycle time (many months or even years), not responsive to changing customer requirements.
Functional spec is completed before design spec starts
Design spec is completed before development, and development before testing
What happens if part way through development the customer's needs have changed?  Or a technology becomes obsolete? 

## Kanban
Kanban board is used to track progress, activity and requirements.
Board results are used to determine velocity.
No development cycle - continuous.
No prescribed roles.

## Scrum
Sprint content is fixed at beginning of sprint.
Prescriptive process based on roles.
- Scrum Master
- Product Owner/Manager
- Developer
Stand up meetings

## Extreme Programming (XP)
Short development cycles (sprints)
Stories sorted in priority order
Stories can be swapped out during sprint for a story of equal value/cost
Stand up meetings

## Terminology
- Sprint - an estimation, planning, development and review cycle - typically just 2-4 weeks
- Scrum master - the person responsible for organizing stand-ups and removing roadblocks from developers
- Stand-up - a very brief (5-15 minutes), frequent (daily) meeting to review the status of story development
- Product Owner - the customer or customer representative who prioritizes the business value of stories.
- Swim Lane - a method of ranking stories by estimated development effort 
- Velocity - average number of development points (effort)/ sprint
- Story Points - value of story/issue assigned by customer/product owner

# Other
Pair Programming - two people, one computer.  One person drives (types) and the other navigates (directs and reviews)
Test Driven Development - tests are written prior to the application.  Test criteria is fixed and development can be very focused.  Eliminates scope creep.
